# SpiralHouse

## Empowering Development Teams Through Open Source

SpiralHouse is dedicated to enhancing the developer experience through open-source tools that help engineering teams
measure, understand, and improve their software delivery performance.

### Our Mission

We build powerful, accessible tooling that allows companies to track their DORA metrics (Deployment Frequency, Lead
Time for Changes, Mean Time to Restore, and Change Failure Rate) and identify specific areas where they can focus
their improvement efforts.

### Our Approach

All SpiralHouse tools are and will always remain completely open source. We believe that the best tools are built
collaboratively, with input from the entire development community. 

We sustain our company through:
- Professional support for enterprise implementations
- Training programs for teams adopting our tools
- Consulting services to help organizations improve their delivery performance

### Our Flagship Project

**AureaCore** - (Coming soon) Our service catalog solution that helps teams discover, organize, and manage their microservices
ecosystem with mathematical precision and intuitive design.

**PhiCD** - (Coming soon) Our continuous delivery tracking system measures key performance indicators across your development
pipeline, providing actionable insights to help teams deliver software faster and more reliably.

### Join Our Community

We're actively seeking contributors to help build PhiCD and our future projects. Whether you're a developer,
designer, or simply passionate about improving software delivery, your contributions can help make development
workflows better for everyone.
